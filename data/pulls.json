        "body": "A re-write of https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/4935\r\nAddresses: https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/4938\r\nand perhaps others.\r\n\r\nIn short, there are three types of values: the instance values (e.g. those passed in via the `get(...)`, `request(...)`, etc.), the session values (e.g. those set for the session such as `s.verify = \"/some/cert\"`), and system or environment level values (e.g. the environment variable for the CA_BUNDLE that, at times, becomes the value for the verify flag).\r\n\r\nWorking with @sorech02, we determined that the best course of action was to just move the session level merging before the environment merging. I.e., the current flow is as follows: one of the simple request calls is made, e.g. `request`, `get`, `delete`, etc., then, the `merge_environment_settings` method is called wherein environment values are merged in (e.g. the CA_BUNDLE value) and then the session level settings are merged in via the `merge_settings` calls in `merge_environment_settings`.\r\n\r\nThis is too late because, by default, trust_env is set to True, which will result in the `verify` value passed into the session merging to not be none. One solution is to make sure you set trust_env to False before using the verify flag with a custom certificate, but we deemed this to only be a work around.\r\n\r\nThe true fix, as described above, is to ensure that the settings which are constructed give the proper precedence to the values given. I.e. passed > session > environment.\r\nWe were forced to leave the `setdefaults` (which effectively reapply the session values if there are no values set) in the `def send` alone because, at times, one might use `send` itself when constructing prepared requests (i.e. not via `request`, `get`, etc.). In which  case, the function must still ensure to use the session level settings.",

I've added the DeepSource config file as well, which can be used to connect requests to DeepSource -- so this analysis runs on every pull-request, which will make it easier to maintain quality on contributions. DeepSource is used by some popular open-source projects, like [uber/ludwig](https://deepsource.io/gh/uber/ludwig/). The product is, and will forever remain, free for open-source.\r\n\r\nTo connect requests and run analysis on every PR, there are three simple steps:\r\n1. **Merge this PR.** I've added a customised `.deepsource.toml` for requests.\r\n2. **Sign up on DeepSource** and grant access to this repository [here](https://deepsource.io/signup/).\r\n3. **Activate analysis** on requests [here](https://deepsource.io/gh/kennethreitz/requests/).\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of DeepSource. We use requests for our code of course, and would love to give back!*",

        "body": "Currently, if there is a read timeout while streaming a response, a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is raised in lieu of a `requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout`. This is unexpected and [contrary to the documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#timeouts).  As a user, I am being forced to catch the `ConnectionError` when I only actually care about the `ReadTimeout` situation.\r\n\r\nThis PR revises the streaming response code to properly raise a `requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout`, consistent with [the non-streaming request behavior](https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/57d7284c1a245cf9fbcecb594f50471d86e879f7/requests/adapters.py#L528). \r\n\r\nI am unable to write a test for this situation since `httpbin` does not support a delay for chunked-encoded responses; see requests/httpbin#479 regarding this lack of functionality.",

        "body": "This was added back in #2195.\r\n\r\nThis started as I was trying to understand why we had PyOpenSSL installed on the project I joined recently. After a bit of digging, it seems that it came from the time when we were using Python 2 and was for Requests/urllib3.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at Requests' documentation, I couldn't find a clear explanation about this feature, so this is my attempt at fixing this.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm by no means an expert at SNI, so please correct me on anything wrong that follows.\r\n\r\nHere are what I could find:\r\n\r\n- The intend was to [document this feature](https://github.com/requests/requests/pull/2195#issuecomment-54524390) after merging it, so I assume this contribution is welcome.\r\n- Looking at [the documentation from urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#ssl-py2), it seems that the extra dependencies aren't needed in Python 3* and by the look of #4315 it can slow down importing Requests when we have PyOpenSSL.\r\n- Another open pull request (#4591) is trying to change this, but @sigmavirus24 comment implies that there is more to SNI in Requests?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the best place to document this, adding it to the \"install\" section feels overwhelming for beginners, and I felt like it belongs close to the SSL & certificates verification of the advanced section. Happy to move it somewhere else.\r\n\r\n*Edit:*\r\n\r\n(*) Actually, it seems it was implemented in [PEP 476](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0476/) which covers Python >=2.7.9 or >=[3.4.3](https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-4-3-final), so not any Python 3 versions.",

(see #4795)\r\n\r\nNote that this delegates to urllib more often, as stated [here](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4795#issuecomment-425886286). I don't have the history behind `should_bypass_proxies` implementation, therefore my change is the tiniest possible (minimum thing to fix the greedy behavior). I don't know exactly why requests tries some things first and then delegates to urllib though.\r\n\r\nFixes #4795 ",

        "body": "this is a quick idea on an approach to address #4455\r\n\r\nwithin `resolve_redirects` exceptions raised by`Session.send` are caught. If they match a given set of tests (currently just the base `ConnectionError` class), the `resp` is replaced with an instance of an exception class used to hold bad response data.  Then a new exception is raised. \r\n\r\nThis makes handling these types of errors similar to handling items without redirects for most users (i did not consider the legacy ways of using requests)\r\n\r\nThe immediate ideas/concerns I have on this:\r\n\r\n1. It might make sense to have a global \"NotARealResponse\" object that stands in for a `Response` object and can contain connection/history info when there is no immediate response.  I'm not sure this is the only use-case for this.\r\n\r\n2. I thought about extending the current exception with request/response data, but this seemed more appropriate.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this is only submitted for discussion/illustration of the other ticket.  This is not a PR for merging.",
